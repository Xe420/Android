Summary

    Use an if statement to set a condition for executing some instructions. For example, if the user rolls the lucky number, print a winning message.
    The Boolean data type has values of true and false and can be used for decision making.
    Compare values using operators such as greater than (>), less than (<), and equal to (==).
    Use a chain of else if statements to set multiple conditions. For example, print a different message for each possible dice roll.
    Use an else statement at the end of a chain of conditions to catch any cases that may not be covered explicitly. If you cover the cases for 6-sided dice, an else statement would catch the 7 and 8 numbers rolled with an 8-sided dice.
    Use a when statement as a compact form of executing code based on comparing a value.

General form of if-else:

if (condition-is-true) {

execute-this-code

} else if (condition-is-true) {

execute-this-code

} else {

execute-this-code

}

When statement:

when (variable) {

matches-value -> execute-this-code

matches-value -> execute-this-code

...

}
